And now it’s time to run your first job – finally!

Create a small job script which:
   - uses the correct project account
   - needs 1 core and has a wall time of 10 minutes
   - will run on the zen2 partition
   - loads the module vsc-tutorial/202203-intel-2024a – according to our advice
   - estimates a 'hello world' script  by using the command: serial_hello

Submit your first job
   - submit the job – use sbatch → you get a job id
   - be patient, the job will start soon – check the job status using squeue 
   - look at what happens – e.g.: which files are generated?
